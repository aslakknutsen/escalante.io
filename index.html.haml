    <h1>Welcome to Escalante</h1>
    </div>

    Escalante is a [Scala](http://scalan-lang.org) application server, based on
    the popular JBoss Application Server 7.

    The goals of *Escalante* are two-fold:

    1. Provide an environment for deploying and running Scala applications that is
    easier to use and more efficient to run than other existing solutions.

    2. Expose EE and other extra services present in JBoss Application Server 7 to
    Scala applications via carefully thought domain-specific-languages (DSL).

    Escalante has been designed with Scala developers in mind and so integrates
    with JBoss Developer Studio and Scala IDE to enable rapid application development.
