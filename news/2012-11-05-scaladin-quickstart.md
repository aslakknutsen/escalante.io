The first external Escalante contribution is in, and it comes from
Risto Yrjänä ([@ristoy](https://twitter.com/ristoy)), who has built a
[Scaladin](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/scaladin) quickstart that
runs on top of Escalante.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<strong>What is Scaladin?</strong> Scaladin is a wrapper that makes it
easier to use <a href="http://vaadin.com">Vaadin Framework</a> with Scala
programming language. <strong>And Vaadin?</strong> Vaadin is a
server-side, java web application development framework which uses GWT to
generate the UI in the browser. To find out more about check
<a href="/faq/#vaadin">Vaadin/Scaladin FAQ section</a>.

Risto has contributed a [Scaladin Hello World
quickstart](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart/tree/master/helloworld-scaladin)
that shows how to build, deploy and run a simple Vaadin component written in
Scala showing a welcome message and the current date and time
(dynamically generated). Here's a screenshot of quickstart:

The example can be built and deployed using either
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [JBoss Developer
Studio](https://devstudio.jboss.com/download/) as shown in the quickstart
instructions. For more details on this quickstart, other Escalante
quickstarts, or how to set up JBoss Developer Studio for Scala, check the
dedicated [Quickstarts](/quickstarts) section.

Risto has another juicy example coming up showing off Scaladin's full potential,
so watch this space for further news!
