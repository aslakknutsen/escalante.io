Last month has been packed with travel, which included speaking at two
fantastic conferences: [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home)
and [JUDCon China](http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china).

I gave the same
["The JBoss Polyglot Revolution - Be Part Of It!"](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/The+JBoss+Polyglot+Revolution+-+Be+part+of+it%21)
presentation in both conferences where I explained our efforts around
running Scala applications on top of JBoss Application Server 7, amongst
other polyglot efforts within JBoss. The polyglot talk I gave in Devoxx 2012
is now live in [Parleys](http://www.parleys.com/), so make sure you register
if you didn't get the chance to attend, or wanna see it all over again :).

In Devoxx, I also had the chance the meet the [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/home)
team which have contributed a couple of
[Scaladin quickstarts](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart)
to run on top of Escalante. During the conference the Vaadin team did an
informal meetup with Vaadin users and I was able to present Escalante
to them, demonstrating the integration between these two technologies.
To find out more about Escalante and Scaladin/Vaadin, check
[these blog posts](/news/tags/scaladin).

There was a very big Scala presence during Devoxx, including talks from
[Joshua Suereth](https://twitter.com/jsuereth) with whom I had the chance to
speak for a few minutes to brainstorm what Escalante's
[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) plugin should look like. I got some very
valuable information out of that discussion, which I'm currently putting
into practice, so stay tuned ;)

Scala developer presence in JUDCon China was smaller, but my polyglot talk
still generated some healthy discussions and debates, particularly with
Errai Lead Mike Brock who has some strong opinions about
[monoglot
development](http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/china/agenda/day2track3.html).

Enough of conferences and meetings for now. It's time to carry on moving
Escalante forward :)
