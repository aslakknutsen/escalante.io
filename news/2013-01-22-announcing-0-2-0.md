We're pleased to announce the second official release of Escalante
- version **_0.2.0_**. We consider this release to be beta quality,
and lacks some of the features and API stability that will end up in the
1.0.0 release.

## What is Escalante?

If this is the first time you've ever heard of Escalante, check out our
[FAQ](/faq) section to find out more about Escalante.

## What's in this release?

This second release focuses on improving support for
[Lift web applications](http://liftweb.net/) within Escalante. These are the
highlights:

* Escalante-optimised Lift applications are now supported in any Lift
version (as long as Maven resolution succeeds, see [documentation](/docs)
for more info), including latest milestone Lift 2.5-M4 release.

* The way Lift applications define metadata so that Escalante can resolve
Scala/Lift dependencies has changed. Instead of the old `WEB-INF/lift.xml`
archive, Escalante now searches for `META-INF/escalante.yml` file, which is
a much more human readable archive thanks to the use of
[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/), and a lot easier to work with from a parsing
perspective. For more info, check the [documentation](/docs).

* Escalante optimised Lift applications can now select which extra Lift
modules to use (i.e. `mapper`, `jpa`, `record`...etc) by defining them in
`META-INF/escalante.yml`, hence reducing burden on permanent space to only
those modules needed. To find out more, check the [documentation](/docs).

* A SBT plugin fully dedicated to Escalante is now available!! Version
`0.1.0` is now available from  [JBoss Nexus
repository](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/io/escalante/sbt/sbt-escalante_2.9.2_0.12/0.1.0/).
This plugin allows several for Escalante-optimised Lift WAR applications
to be created (including generation of `META-INF/escalante.yml`),
and it can deploy these applications to an Escalante instance
(embedded, no separate process!) from the SBT console thanks to the
`escalante-run` command. I'd like to personally thank
[Josh Suereth](http://jsuereth.com/) for the chat we had at Devoxx 2012 that
kicked off the development of the SBT plugin, and
[David Pollak](http://blog.goodstuff.im/), Lift founder and
lead, for motivating me to enable Escalante instances to be started from SBT.
Thanks guys!! Check the
[Escalante SBT Git repo](https://github.com/escalante/sbt-escalante) to
find out out more about the Escalante SBT plugin.

* Escalante Quickstarts have now been tagged for version
[`0.2.0`](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart/tree/0.2.0) and the
great news is **Escalante Quickstarts now have SBT build files as well as the
existing Maven files**. So, regardless of whether you use SBT or Maven,
Escalante's got you covered :). The SBT files are configured with the
Escalante SBT plugin, so you can get started with the newly created Escalant
SBT plugin right away!

* A [new Escalante
Quickstart](https://github.com/escalante/escalante-quickstart/tree/0.2.0/library-lift-jpa)
has been added showcasing interaction of Lift applications with [JPA
2.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html).
Although injection of `@PersistenceContext` or `@PersistenceUnit`
instances is not yet available, Lift developers wanting
to run their JPA applications in Escalante are recommended that they bind
the EntityManagerFactory instance to JNDI.

## What's next?

This new Escalante version uses a newer base JBoss EAP version than
the one you can currently access via
[OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/), so the previous instructions
provided to run Escalante in OpenShift might not work as expected.
Over the next few weeks we'll be working on getting Escalante 0.2.0 working on
 OpenShift, hopefully with a dedicated cartdridge.

On top of that, now that Escalante SBT integration is in place, we'll start
looking into how to get Play applications run on top of Escalante, as well
as carry on developing Escalante Lift integration adding more
quickstarts...etc.

## Get It

The simplest way to install 0.2.0 is [downloading our binary distribution](/download).
