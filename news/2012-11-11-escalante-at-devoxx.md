Just arrived in Antwerp, where Devoxx 2012 conference is being held, and I
wanted to share some information with the community on the Escalante related
events happening in this mamooth, week-long, conference:

# Monday

Not sure how this is gonna work out, but a couple of very interesting BOFs
are happening at the same time: On one side, the [Scala Enthousiasts
Gathering](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Scala+Enthusiasts+Gathering) and
in the other, JBoss Polyglot colleague Ben Browning will be talking about
[Why JRuby and TorqueBox Belong in Your Java Tool
Box](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Why+JRuby+and+TorqueBox+Belong+in+Your+Java+Tool+Box)
which is likely to include some discussions around the JBoss Polygloy
movement, which Escalante is part of.

# Tuesday

I'll be attending the [Hackergarten Hands-On Coding
Day](http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/hackergarten_devoxx_2012)
for which I've selected some Escalante coding tasks to suggest attendeees.
Escalante is in its infancy, so there couldn't be a better moment to get
involved with the project! :)

# Thursday

I'll be presenting [JBoss Polyglot Revolution - Be part of
it!](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/The+JBoss+Polyglot+Revolution+-+Be+part+of+it%21)
session where I'll be speaking not only about Escalante, but also the other
initiatives Red Hat/JBoss is working to provide middleware for users writing
applications in other languages such as: JRuby (Ruby), Jython (Python)...etc.

# Ping me!

If you wanna have a chat about Escalante stuff (i.e. Lift and Play
integration, SBT work, quickstart suggestions...etc), get in touch with me
via [@galderz](http://twitter.com/galderz) or [@escalanteio](http://twitter.com/escalanteio)

even better!) :)
