We're pleased to announce the first official release of Escalante
- version **_0.1.0_**. We consider this release to be beta quality,
and lacks some of the features and API stability that will end up in the
1.0.0 release.

## What is Escalante?

Escalante is an application server for [Scala](http://scalan-lang.org).
It's an integrated platform built on [JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7)
that aims to provide an environment for deploying and running Scala
applications that is easier to use and more efficient to run than other
existing solutions.

## What's in this release?

For this first release, we've focused on [Lift web applications](http://liftweb.net/),
trying to make them easier and leaner to deploy compared to other plattforms.
With just a little bit of information, Escalante can vastly reduce the size of
your deployments and can make it more efficient to run multipl Lift
applications in paralell within the same Escalante server. You can find out
more by checking [Escalante's documentation](/docs).

## What's next?

Now that we have 0.1.0 out the door, we'll be focusing on:

* [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/) cartdridge for Lift applications
* Providing more Lift quickstarts
* Investigate other Scala frameworks
* [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) build files
for Escalante quickstarts

## Get It

The simplest way to install 0.1.0 is [downloading our binary distribution](/download).

inspired me to get Escalante started, to the [Project:odd](http://projectodd.org/)

ever release, setting up the site, put up with my questions...etc ;).
Thanks you all.
