The Escalante team is a distributed team, so you can be as close to the action
as anyone else by participating on IRC.  IRC is our virtual office
(and virtual watercooler) so fire up an IRC client and stop in.

[`irc.freenode.net #escalante`](irc://irc.freenode.net/escalante)

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the
[web chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=immutant) interface.
