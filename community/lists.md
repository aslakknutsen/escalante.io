<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>
</div>

We provide both user and developer mailing lists. Anyone is welcome to join
either list.

User List
---------
The user list is where most discussions occur. The focus of the user list is
indeed issues & suggestions related to the use of Escalante. If you think
you've found a bug or are having issues using Escalante, the user list is an
excellent place to start. The community can help determine if you're having a
simple usage issue, or have found a true defect.

The developers of the Escalante project participate on the user list regularly.

Developer List
--------------
The developer list is where the developers discuss internal designs, choices
and complexity. If you are interested in the inner workings and how they are
built, the developer list is an excellent resource.

Since the developers also participate on the user list, there is no need to
initiate bug reports on the developer list. The developers will escalate true
defects to the developer list to determine the proper course of action.
