Escalante is a [Scala](http://scalan-lang.org) application server, based on
the popular JBoss Application Server 7.

The goal of *Escalante* is to provide an environment for deploying and running
Scala applications that is easier to use and more efficient to run than other
existing solutions.

Escalante has been designed with Scala developers in mind and so integrates
with JBoss Developer Studio and Scala IDE to enable rapid application
development.
